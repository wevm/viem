One common example is an ERC-20 approval followed by spending that approval, a common workflow in DEXes that requires two transactions today. Advanced use cases of batching occasionally involve dependencies: the output of the first operation is part of the input to the second operation. [Example](/experimental/eip7702/contract-writes#5-invoke-contract-function)\\n- **Sponsorship**: account X pays for a transaction on behalf of account Y. Account X could be paid in some other ERC-20 for this service, or it could be an application operator including the transactions of its users for free. [Example](/experimental/eip7702/contract-writes#6-optional-use-a-sponsor)\\n- **Privilege de-escalation**: users can sign sub-keys, and give them specific permissions that are much weaker than global access to the account. For example, you could imagine a permission to spend ERC-20 tokens but not ETH, or to spend up to 1% of total balance per day, or to interact only with a specific application.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n- [Extending Client with EIP-7702](/experimental/eip7702/client)\\n- [Contract Writes](/experimental/eip7702/contract-writes)\\n- [Sending Transactions](/experimental/eip7702/sending-transactions)\",\"document\":[{\"href\":\"/experimental/eip7702#eip-7702-overview\",\"html\":\"</header>\\n<p>EIP-7702 is a proposal to add a new Transaction type to allow an EOA to designate a Smart Contract as its &quot;implementation&quot;.</p>\\n<p>The main difference between an EIP-7702 Transaction and other transactions is the inclusion of a <strong>&quot;authorization list&quot;</strong> property, a set of <code>(chain_id, contract_address, nonce, y_parity, r, s)</code> tuples that depict what Contract bytecode(s) should be injected onto the Externally Owned Account during execution.</p>\\n<aside data-callout=\\\"note\\\"><p>In Viem, you won&#x27;t need to worry about constructing these Authorization Tuples manually as you can use <a href=\\\"/experimental/eip7702/signAuthorization\\\"><code>signAuthorization</code></a> to generate them and use them in <a href=\\\"/experimental/eip7702/contract-writes\\\">Transaction APIs</a>.</p></aside>\\n<p>Applications of EIP-7702 include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Batching</strong>: allowing multiple operations from the same user in one atomic transaction.
