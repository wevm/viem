description: Getting started with experimental features in Viem
---

# Getting Started

Viem provides a set of experimental features through the `viem/experimental` entrypoint. Such features could include: 

- implementation of non-finalized EIP proposals.
- features that have not been adopted by the wider ecosystem.
- features that are not considered stable.

:::warning[Warning]
It is recommended to not solely use experimental features in production. You should always have a fallback mechanism for unsupported features.
:::

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up your Client & Transport

Firstly, set up your [Client](/docs/clients/intro) with a desired [Transport](/docs/clients/intro) & [Chain](/docs/chains/introduction).

```ts
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const client = createWalletClient({ // [!code focus]
  chain: mainnet, // [!code focus]
  transport: custom(window.ethereum!), // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]
```

:::info
In a production app, it is highly recommended to pass through your authenticated RPC provider URL (Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, etc). If no URL is provided, viem will default to a public RPC provider. [Read more](/docs/clients/transports/http#usage).
:::

### 2. Extend Client with Experimental Actions

Now that you have a Client set up, you can extend it with Experimental Actions! [Read more.](/experimental/client)

```ts
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { base } from 'viem/chains'
import { walletActionsEip5792 } from 'viem/experimental' // [!code focus]

const client = createWalletClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum!),
}).extend(walletActionsEip5792()) // [!code focus]
```

### 3. Consume Experimental Actions

Now that you have an Experimental Client set up, you can now and consume [Actions](/experimental/eip5792/sendCalls)!

```tsx
import { createWalletClient, custom, parseEther } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
import { walletActionsEip5792 } from 'viem/experimental'

const client = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum!),
}).extend(walletActionsEip5792()) 

const id = await client.sendCalls({ // [!code focus]
  account: '0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266', // [!code focus]
  calls: [// [!code focus]
    {// [!code focus]
      to: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8', // [!code focus]
      value: parseEther('1'), // [!code focus]
    },// [!code focus]
    {// [!code focus]
      data: '0xdeadbeef'// [!code focus]
      to: '0xa5cc3c03994DB5b0d9A5eEdD10CabaB0813678AC', // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
  ] // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]
```
