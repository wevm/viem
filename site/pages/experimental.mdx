description: Getting started with experimental features in Viem

# Getting Started

Viem provides a set of experimental features through the `viem/experimental` entrypoint. Such features could include: 

- implementation of non-finalized EIP proposals.
- features that have not been adopted by the wider ecosystem.
- features that are not considered stable.

:::warning[Warning]
It is recommended to not solely use experimental features in production. You should always have a fallback mechanism for unsupported features.
