Cross chain USDC transfers allow you to move USDC between different blockchains using [Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started).

Choose your preferred approach below to get started:

## Options

**CCTP Integration with Bridge Kit** – Start bridging in just 10 lines of code using Circle's high-level SDK. Perfect for quick integration with built-in fee collection, retry capabilities, and support for hundreds of bridge routes. Great for building bridging in an embedded wallet experience.

**CCTP Integration** – Direct integration with CCTP for complete control over every step of the transfer process. Ideal for developers who need fine-grained control and understanding of the underlying protocol.
