[USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc) is a digital dollar issued by Circle, also known as a stablecoin, running on many of the world's leading blockchains. Designed to represent US dollars on the internet, USDC is backed 100% by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets so that it's always redeemable 1:1 for USD.

This section provides a set of tutorials that demonstrate how to integrate and interact with USDC using the Viem library.

These guides walk through core patterns and advanced capabilities that developers can build on top of USDC â€” including basic token operations, cross-chain transfers, and gas abstraction via stablecoins.

Whether you're building a wallet, protocol integration, or a developer tool, this section will help you implement USDC support using Viem's type-safe primitives and modern client architecture.
