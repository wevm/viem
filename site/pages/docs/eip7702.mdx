# EIP-7702 Overview

EIP-7702 is a proposal to add a new Transaction type to allow an EOA to designate a Smart Contract as its "implementation".

The main difference between an EIP-7702 Transaction and other transactions is the inclusion of a **"authorization list"** property, a set of `(chain_id, contract_address, nonce, y_parity, r, s)` tuples that depict what Contract bytecode(s) should be injected onto the Externally Owned Account during execution. 

:::note
In Viem, you won't need to worry about constructing these Authorization Tuples manually as you can use [`signAuthorization`](/experimental/eip7702/signAuthorization) to generate them and use them in [Transaction APIs](/experimental/eip7702/contract-writes).

Applications of EIP-7702 include:

- **Batching**: allowing multiple operations from the same user in one atomic transaction. One common example is an ERC-20 approval followed by spending that approval, a common workflow in DEXes that requires two transactions today. Advanced use cases of batching occasionally involve dependencies: the output of the first operation is part of the input to the second operation. [Example](/experimental/eip7702/contract-writes#5-invoke-contract-function)
- **Sponsorship**: account X pays for a transaction on behalf of account Y. Account X could be paid in some other ERC-20 for this service, or it could be an application operator including the transactions of its users for free. [Example](/experimental/eip7702/contract-writes#6-optional-use-a-sponsor)
- **Privilege de-escalation**: users can sign sub-keys, and give them specific permissions that are much weaker than global access to the account. For example, you could imagine a permission to spend ERC-20 tokens but not ETH, or to spend up to 1% of total balance per day, or to interact only with a specific application.
