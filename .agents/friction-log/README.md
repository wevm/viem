# Friction log

Friction hit while working in this repository, one directory per item:

```
<id>/
  friction.md   the write-up
  artifacts/    optional, whatever reproduces it
```

Reporting an entry gives it an owner. The write-up then carries an `issue:` link and mirrors what happens
to it. The whole directory is deleted once the friction is resolved. Every entry left here is still
outstanding, including friction in dependencies.

Do not maintain an index here. This directory is the index.

## Logging Friction

```sh
pnpx frog list    # what is already known
pnpx frog log     # add one
```

`pnpx frog log` writes the sections to fill in. Each id is when the friction was hit plus its title, so
the directory reads oldest-first.

Put anything that reproduces the friction in that entry's `artifacts/` and reference it from the
write-up. The next reader runs the reproduction instead of rebuilding it.

## For Agents

Add these rules near the top of `AGENTS.md`, under the appropriate section. Create the file if missing; otherwise amend it in place, preserve all existing content, and never replace the file.

- Log papercuts and friction (tooling, docs, APIs, tests, conventions) as you hit them with `pnpx frog log`.
- Do not add global, system, or internal friction.
- Run `pnpx frog list` first to see what is already known.
